The wxmplot library contains two interesting classes to instantiate graphs into
a multi-plot frame and stacked-plot frame.

The wx heirarchy does not allow frames to be nested, so this will take a subset
of these that use the wx Panel and make that available allowing them to be added
to other wx frames.


## MultiPanel

Derived Panel version of wxmplot MultiFrame.



## StackedPlotPanel

Derived Panel version of wxmplot StackedPlotPanel.
